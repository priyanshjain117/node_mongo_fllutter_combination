# Flutter + Node.js Backend Integration

This project was created as a **learning exercise** to understand how to connect a **Flutter frontend** with a **Node.js + Express backend**, using **MongoDB Atlas** for cloud data storage.

## 🎯 Goal

To build a basic full-stack app where:
- The **Flutter app** can send and receive data from a backend server.
- The **Node.js server** handles API requests and stores user data in **MongoDB Atlas**.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

| Layer        | Tech                            |
|--------------|----------------------------------|
| Frontend     | Flutter, Dart, `http` package    |
| Backend      | Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB     |
| Database     | MongoDB Atlas (Cloud)            |
| Tools Used   | Postman (API testing), Compass (MongoDB GUI), Nodemon |

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Connect Flutter to local Node.js backend
- ✅ POST user data from Flutter to Node
- ✅ Store user data in MongoDB Atlas
- ✅ Set up a project folder structure for frontend + backend
- ✅ Future-ready for deployment (Render, Vercel, etc.)

## 🗂️ Folder Structure

your-repo/
├── backend/ ← Node.js backend project
└── flutter_app/ ← Flutter frontend app


## 🚀 What's Next

- Add more REST API endpoints (GET, PUT, DELETE)
- Add authentication (JWT)
- Deploy backend to **Render**
- Host frontend using **Firebase Hosting**, **GitHub Pages**, or Play Store

## 📚 Learning Outcome

This project helped in understanding how mobile apps can communicate with backend APIs, and how to structure full-stack applications for real-world use.
